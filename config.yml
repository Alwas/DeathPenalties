#
# you can add worlds here to set per world custom values
# if a world is not added here default values will be used instead
# if an option is missing it will be set to its default value
# be careful to respect the format otherwise the plugin will ignore it
#
# for flat values if value <= 0 percentage value is used instead
# percentage values are ignored if you have set a flat value > 0
#
# for inventory values destroyed and dropped values can both be done on player death
